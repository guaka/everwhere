<h3>Where do you want to take this?</h3>

Everwhere! Kasper cofounded Hitchwiki and Trashwiki.  These have become major sources of information to find hidden treasures and free transport.  Kasper has also worked on couchsurfing, which is definitely an awesome community, but it's missing real time and it's mostly about the couch.  There's much more to share and there's much more potential adventure when things become real time.
